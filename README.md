# Accordion FAQ Project

A simple and interactive FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) accordion implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Interactive accordion-style FAQ section
- Clean and responsive design
- Smooth toggle animations
- Easy to customize questions and answers
- Mobile-friendly interface

## Project Structure

```
├── accordion.html    # Main HTML file containing the FAQ structure
├── accordion.css     # Stylesheet for the accordion design
└── fac.png          # Project favicon
```

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `accordion.html` in your web browser
3. Click on any question to expand/collapse its answer

## How It Works

The accordion functionality is implemented using vanilla JavaScript. Each question is clickable and toggles the visibility of its corresponding answer. The implementation uses:

- Event listeners for click interactions
- DOM manipulation to show/hide content
- CSS for styling and animations

## Customization

To add more FAQ items:

1. Copy the existing question-answer structure in `accordion.html`
2. Add your new question and answer
3. Create a new JavaScript function for the toggle functionality
4. Update the onclick attribute with your new function name
